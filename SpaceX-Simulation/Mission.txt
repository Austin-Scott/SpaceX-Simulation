11|CASSIOPE|Commercial mission and first Falcon 9 v1.1 flight, with improved 13-tonne to LEO capacity. Following second-stage separation from the first stage, an attempt was made to perform an ocean touchdown test of the discarded booster vehicle. The test provided good test data on the experiment-its primary objective-but as the booster neared the ocean, aerodynamic forces caused an uncontrollable roll.

14|SpaceX CRS-3|Following second-stage separation, SpaceX conducted a second controlled-descent test of the discarded booster vehicle and achieved the first successful controlled ocean touchdown of a liquid-rocket-engine orbital booster. Following touchdown the first stage tipped over as expected and was destroyed.

15|Orbcomm-OG2-M1|Total payload mass was 1,316 kg (2,901 lb) : 6 satellites weighing 172 kg each, plus two 142-kg mass simulators. This was the second Falcon 9 booster equipped with landing legs. Following second-stage separation, SpaceX conducted a controlled-descent test of the first stage, which successfully decelerated from hypersonic velocity in the upper atmosphere, made reentry and landing burns, deployed its legs and touched down on the ocean surface.

25|Orbcomm OG2|Total payload mass was 2,034 kg (4,484 lb) : 11 satellites weighing 172 kg each, plus a 142-kg mass simulator. This was the first launch of the upgraded v1.1 variant (later called Falcon 9 Full Thrust), with a 30 percent power increase. Orbcomm had originally agreed to be the third flight of the enhanced-thrust rocket, but the change to the maiden flight position was announced in October 2015.
