9|SpaceX CRS-1|CRS-1 successful, but the secondary payload was inserted into abnormally low orbit and lost due to Falcon 9 boost stage engine failure, ISS visiting vehicle safety rules, and the primary payload owner's contractual right to decline a second ignition of the second stage under some conditions.|2012-10-08|ccafs_slc_40

11|CASSIOPE|Commercial mission and first Falcon 9 v1.1 flight, with improved 13-tonne to LEO capacity. Following second-stage separation from the first stage, an attempt was made to perform an ocean touchdown test of the discarded booster vehicle. The test provided good test data on the experiment-its primary objective-but as the booster neared the ocean, aerodynamic forces caused an uncontrollable roll. The center engine, depleted of fuel by centrifugal force, shut down resulting in the impact and destruc|2013-09-29|vafb_slc_4e

14|SpaceX CRS-3|Following second-stage separation, SpaceX conducted a second controlled-descent test of the discarded booster vehicle and achieved the first successful controlled ocean touchdown of a liquid-rocket-engine orbital booster. Following touchdown the first stage tipped over as expected and was destroyed. This was the first Falcon 9 booster to fly with extensible landing legs and the first Dragon mission with the Falcon 9 v1.1 launch vehicle.|2014-04-18|ccafs_slc_40
15|Orbcomm-OG2-M1|Total payload mass was 1,316 kg (2,901 lb) : 6 satellites weighing 172 kg each, plus two 142-kg mass simulators. This was the second Falcon 9 booster equipped with landing legs. Following second-stage separation, SpaceX conducted a controlled-descent test of the first stage, which successfully decelerated from hypersonic velocity in the upper atmosphere, made reentry and landing burns, deployed its legs and touched down on the ocean surface. As with the previous mission, the first stage then t|2014-07-14|ccafs_slc_40

19|SpaceX CRS-5|Following second stage separation, SpaceX performed a test flight which attempted to return the first stage of the Falcon 9 through the atmosphere and land it on an approximately 90-by-50-meter (300 ft x 160 ft) floating platform-called the autonomous spaceport drone ship. Many of the test objectives were achieved, including precision control of the rocket's descent to land on the platform at a specific point in the Atlantic ocean, and a large amount of test data was obtained from the first use|2015-01-10|ccafs_slc_40
20|DSCOVR|First launch under USAF's OSP 3 launch contract. First SpaceX launch to put a satellite to an orbit with an orbital altitude many times the distance to the Moon: Sun-Earth libration point L1. The first stage made a test flight descent to an over-ocean landing within 10 m (33 ft) of its intended target.|2015-02-11|ccafs_slc_40
21|ABS-3A|The launch was Boeing's first-ever conjoined launch of a lighter-weight dual-commsat stack that was specifically designed to take advantage of the lower-cost SpaceX Falcon 9 launch vehicle. Per satellite, launch costs were less than $30 million. The ABS satellite reached its final destination ahead of schedule and started operations on September 10.|2015-03-02|ccafs_slc_40
22|SpaceX CRS-6|Following the first-stage boost, SpaceX attempted a controlled-descent test of the first stage. The first stage contacted the ship, but soon tipped over due to excess lateral velocity caused by a stuck throttle valve resulting in a later-than-intended downthrottle.|2015-04-14|ccafs_slc_40

The Dragon capsule survived the explosion but was lost upon splashdown because its software did not contain provisions for parachute deployment on launch vehicle failure.|2015-06-28|ccafs_slc_40
25|Orbcomm OG2|Total payload mass was 2,034 kg (4,484 lb) : 11 satellites weighing 172 kg each, plus a 142-kg mass simulator. This was the first launch of the upgraded v1.1 variant (later called Falcon 9 Full Thrust), with a 30 percent power increase. Orbcomm had originally agreed to be the third flight of the enhanced-thrust rocket, but the change to the maiden flight position was announced in October 2015. SpaceX received a permit from the FAA to land the booster on solid ground at Cape Canaveral, and succe|2015-12-22|ccafs_slc_40
26|Jason-3|First launch of NASA and NOAA joint science mission under the NLS II launch contract (not related to NASA CRS or USAF OSP3 contracts). Last launch of the original Falcon 9 v1.1 launch vehicle. The Jason-3 satellite was successfully deployed to target orbit. SpaceX again attempted a recovery of the first stage booster by landing on an autonomous drone ship; this time located in the Pacific Ocean. The first stage did achieve a soft-landing on the ship, but a lockout on one of the landing legs fai|2016-01-17|vafb_slc_4e
27|SES-9|Second launch of the enhanced Falcon 9 Full Thrust launch vehicle. Following the launch, SpaceX attempted an experimental landing test to a drone ship, although a successful landing was not expected because launch mass exceeded previously indicated limit for a GTO there was little fuel left. As predicted, booster recovery failed: the spent first stage "landed hard", but the controlled-descent, atmospheric re-entry and navigation to the drone ship were successful and returned significant test da|2016-03-04|ccafs_slc_40
28|SpaceX CRS-8|Dragon carried over 1500 kg of supplies and delivered (stowed in its trunk) the inflatable Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM) to the ISS for two years of in-orbit tests. The rocket's first stage landed smoothly on SpaceX's autonomous spaceport drone ship 9 minutes after liftoff, making this the first ever successful landing of a rocket booster on a ship at sea as part of an orbital launch.

33|JCSAT-16|First attempt to touch down from a ballistic trajectory using a single-engine landing burn. All previous landings from a ballistic trajectory had fired three engines on the landing-burn, which provided more braking force, but subjected the vehicle to greater structural stresses. The single-engine landing burn takes more time and fuel, but puts less stress on the vehicle.|2016-08-14|ccafs_slc_40

35|Iridium NEXT 1|Return-to-flight mission after the loss of Amos-6 in September 2016. Iridium NEXT will replace the original Iridium constellation, launched in the late 1990s. Each Falcon mission will carry 10 satellites, with a goal to complete deployment of the 66 plus 9 spare satellite constellation by mid 2018. The first two Iridium qualification units were supposed to ride a Dnepr rocket in April 2016 but were delayed, so Iridium decided to qualify the first batch of 10 satellites instead.|2017-01-14|vafb_slc_4e
